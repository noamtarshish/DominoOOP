Domino Game - Python OOP Project

Project Overview:
This Python project is a simulation of a domino game that was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The game involves multiple players, each of whom receives a set of domino tiles at the beginning.

Rules of the Game:
At the start of the game, each player is given an identical set of domino tiles, which are hidden from the other players. The number of domino tiles may vary from game to game.
The game board, initially empty, is used for players to place their domino tiles. A player can place a tile adjacent to another tile if at least one side of the new tile matches one of the adjacent sides of the existing tile (see the example in the image below).

The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:

A player runs out of domino tiles.
No player can make a valid move, i.e., there are no matching sides to place a tile.
When the game ends, the player with the lowest total value of unplayed domino tiles is declared the winner.
